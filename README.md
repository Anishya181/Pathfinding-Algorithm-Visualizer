# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer üó∫Ô∏è

An interactive web application built with Next.js and TypeScript that visualizes classic pathfinding algorithms in real-time. This project serves as an educational tool to help understand the behavior, strengths, and weaknesses of different graph traversal strategies.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Algorithm Visualization**: Watch Dijkstra's, A* Search, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) in action.
* **Interactive Grid**: Click and drag on the grid to draw walls and create custom mazes.
* **Step-by-Step Animation**: See the "search" process as the algorithm explores nodes, followed by the animation of the final shortest path.
* **User Controls**: Easily select an algorithm, start the visualization, clear the path, or reset the entire board.

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Create a Maze**: Click and drag your mouse on the white grid cells to draw walls (obstacles).
2.  **Select an Algorithm**: Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3.  **Visualize**: Click the "Visualize!" button to see the selected algorithm solve the maze.
4.  **Reset**: Use the "Clear Path" button to remove the animation or "Clear Board" to reset the grid and walls.
